# User Analysis Report

## Background

The general demographic for the project is the Warhammer 40,000 community as a whole. Finding official data is difficult, as Games Workshop doesn't release their demographic data. However, less official sources and the general consensus seems to place the community in the 18+ category. The hobby is quite expensive, so being a working professional is necessary, or at least having a stable source of income of some kind. I would estimate, given the game's age, that the average player is roughly 20-40 years old, which is consistent with information done informally by individual game stores. While the project would benefit anyone in that demographic, it would benefit most those with a deeper interest in the lore of the setting, people who enjoy the story just as much as the gameplay, or who have never actually played the tabletop game and are fans of the video games, books, or other media. Playing the tabletop game is not a necessary requirement to enjoy a roleplaying game set in the same universe, after all.

## Identified Need

The current iteration of the rulebook has long been criticized since its inception as difficult to use. The criticisms have been harsh, and the game has certainly lost potential players because of the perceived incompetence of the game's designers. By re-organizing the book to appeal to a wider audience, not just the type of people who pore over lore books and supplementary media, the book can reach more people and gain more popularity.

## Variability

The fringe cases would be an individual coming to the game as a roleplaying game first and a piece of Warhammer media second. In other words, a person looking at the game for its quality as a game with little to no experience with the setting. This would present an additional problem, though the book itself already provides a brief overview of the setting's core concepts. However, it would be wise to keep in mind this type of possible player.

## Barriers to Delivery

The rights to the game are owned by Games Workshop, and distribution of a revised edition could present legal problems.
